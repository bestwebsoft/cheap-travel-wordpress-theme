== Theme Notes ==

= Slider =

After the theme is installed, the metabox "Slider Settings" will appear in WordPress admin panel in the post editing section.
In this metabox you will see two input fields: text-field and checkbox. If you mark the checkbox, the featured image of this particular post will appear in the slider.
Every post (or page) has its own metabox, so if you go to another post (or page) and mark the checkbox, there the featured image of that post (or page) will be added to the slider as well, and the slider will have two slides. You can add as many posts (or pages) to the slider as you want.
The slider itself is located on the frontpage and consists of four parts: description (short description typed into the text-field in the metabox "Slider Settings"), title (title of post), learn more (Displays the excerpt of the current post), image (featured image of the post).
